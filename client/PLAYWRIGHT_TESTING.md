# Playwright Test Coverage Expansion

## Overview
This document outlines the expanded Playwright test coverage for the Azure DevOps Dashboard client with mocked API functionality.

## Mock API Implementation Analysis

### Current Mocking Strategy
The application employs a dual mocking approach:

1. **Application-Level Mocking** (`src/services/mockApiService.ts`)
   - Used when `REACT_APP_API_URL` is empty (triggering `apiIsMocked=true` in appConfig.ts)
   - Provides comprehensive mock data for all API endpoints
   - Used by the application during development and when no backend is available
   - **Status: REQUIRED - Not redundant**

2. **Test-Level Mocking** (`e2e/helpers/mockApi.ts`)
   - Used by Playwright tests to intercept HTTP requests
   - Provides consistent mock responses for E2E testing
   - Allows control over API responses during testing
   - **Status: REQUIRED - Not redundant**

### Investigation Results: mockApiService.ts vs mockApi.ts
Both files serve different but essential purposes:

- **mockApiService.ts**: Application runtime mocking for development/demo
- **mockApi.ts**: Test-time HTTP request interception for E2E tests

**Recommendation**: Both files should be retained as they serve different architectural layers.

## Expanded Test Coverage

### New Test Files Created

#### 1. Enhanced `smoke.spec.ts`
- Uncommented and improved existing tests for builds, configuration, and release pages
- Added proper wait times and enhanced assertions
- Added screenshot capture for visual verification with improved naming
- Screenshots saved as `smoke-{page}-page.png` for easy identification

#### 2. `comprehensive.spec.ts`
- **Navigation and Routing Tests**: Validates all route transitions
- **Dashboard/Deployments View Tests**: Pipeline status grid functionality
- **Builds View Tests**: Build table display and filtering
- **Release View Tests**: Release candidate workflow
- **Configuration View Tests**: Form interactions and validation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Edge cases and loading states
- **Data Loading Tests**: Mock data consistency across views
- **Accessibility Tests**: Basic accessibility validation
- **Responsive Design Tests**: Multiple viewport sizes

#### 3. `interactive.spec.ts`
- **Project Selection Tests**: Cross-view project filtering
- **Build Filtering Tests**: Status, branch, and reason filtering
- **Release Interactions**: Release candidate selection workflow
- **Data Loading States**: Network delay simulation
- **UI Responsiveness**: Rapid interaction handling
- **Form Functionality**: Configuration form validation

#### 4. `mock-validation.spec.ts`
- **Mock API Validation**: Verifies mock responses work correctly
- **Configuration Mode Tests**: Validates mocked vs real API states
- **Data Consistency Tests**: Ensures mock data loads properly

### Test Configuration Updates

#### `playwright.config.ts`
- Temporarily limited to Chromium browser (due to CI environment constraints)
- Can be re-enabled for Firefox and WebKit when browsers are properly installed
- Maintains comprehensive test reporter configuration

#### `package.json`
Added new test scripts:
- `test:e2e:comprehensive`: Runs comprehensive test suite
- `test:e2e:interactive`: Runs interactive feature tests  
- `test:e2e:validation`: Runs mock API validation tests
- `test:e2e:all`: Runs all main test suites

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Core Functionality
- [x] Home page loading with mock data
- [x] Navigation between all main views (Deployments, Builds, Release, Configuration)
- [x] Project selection and filtering across views
- [x] Data loading and display with mock API responses
- [x] Form interactions in configuration view

### User Interactions
- [x] Dropdown/combobox interactions
- [x] Rapid navigation between views
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] Responsive design across viewport sizes
- [x] Filter selection and application

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [x] Slow network condition simulation
- [x] Empty data response handling
- [x] Loading state management
- [x] Rapid user interaction handling

### Accessibility & UX
- [x] Proper heading structure validation
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] Focus management
- [x] Mobile/tablet viewport compatibility

## Mock API Configuration for Tests

### Environment Setup
Tests run with the following configuration:
- `apiIsMocked=true` (automatic when `REACT_APP_API_URL` is empty)
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` is left empty
- Mock data served by `MockApiService` for application logic
- HTTP requests intercepted by `setupComprehensiveMockApi` for E2E tests

### Mock Data Coverage
- **Projects**: Multiple sample projects with realistic metadata
- **Pipelines**: Various pipeline types across different projects
- **Builds**: Builds with different statuses, branches, and reasons
- **Deployments**: Deployment history across multiple environments
- **Jira Integration**: Mock Jira issue responses for testing integration

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all smoke tests
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:e2e:comprehensive

# Run interactive feature tests
npm run test:e2e:interactive

# Run mock API validation
npm run test:e2e:validation

# Run all main test suites
npm run test:e2e:all

# View test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Test Results
Tests generate:
- HTML reports with pass/fail status
- Screenshots for visual verification
- Trace files for debugging failed tests
- CTRF JSON reports for CI integration

### CI Screenshot Visibility Enhancements

Enhanced CI configuration provides multiple ways to view test screenshots:

#### 1. GitHub Actions Summary
- **Automatic Summary**: Each test run generates a summary showing:
  - Screenshot count and file sizes
  - Video count and file sizes (if any)
  - Direct artifact download instructions
  - Links to interactive reports

#### 2. Automated PR Comments
- **Bot Comments**: Automatic comments on PRs with:
  - List of all generated screenshots and videos
  - Direct links to workflow artifacts
  - Step-by-step instructions for accessing files
  - File size information for quick assessment

#### 3. Organized Artifacts
- **Enhanced Artifacts**: `playwright-test-results` artifact includes:
  - `test-results/` - Individual screenshots and videos
  - `playwright-report/` - Interactive HTML report
  - `test-artifacts-summary.md` - Complete inventory of test artifacts

#### 4. How to Access Screenshots
1. **View Workflow Summary**: Click on any workflow run to see immediate overview
2. **Check PR Comments**: Look for automated bot comments with direct instructions
3. **Download Artifacts**: Get `playwright-test-results` artifact for full access
4. **Open Reports**: Use `playwright-report/index.html` for interactive browsing

#### 5. Test Artifact Organization Script
- **Automatic Organization**: `scripts/organize-test-artifacts.js` runs after tests
- **Detailed Summaries**: Generates markdown summary with file sizes and descriptions
- **Console Output**: Provides immediate feedback during CI runs

## Recommendations

1. **Browser Installation**: Resolve Playwright browser download issues for full cross-browser testing
2. **CI Integration**: Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Visual Regression**: Consider adding visual regression testing for UI changes
4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for application performance with large datasets
5. **Real API Testing**: Create separate test suite for real API integration when available

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been significantly expanded with comprehensive scenarios covering:
- All major application views and navigation
- User interactions and data filtering
- Error handling and edge cases
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Mock API functionality validation

Both mock implementations (`mockApiService.ts` and `mockApi.ts`) are necessary and serve different purposes. The test suite provides confidence in the application's functionality when running with mocked APIs, making it suitable for development, demo, and testing environments.
